				"Hello there, cutiee~", 
				"Upon our first encounter, \nI never anticipated the profound affection I would develop for her. \nIndeed, who could resist her ethereal beauty, \nintelligence, and strong family values? \nHer captivating personality is simply irresistible.", 
				"Yeyyy, I was with her at the DSPC, and I remember that moment when our feet touched. It was so comforting. It means so much to me that she didn't mind when I constantly rubbed or touched her feet with mine. I fell for her even more; I could have died in that moment.(｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡",
				"I don't know why I constantly think about her. She always catches my attention, but I try not to show it.",
				"I constantly see her in my peripheral vision.  Naramdaman mo ba yung feeling na siya lang nakikita mo kahit andaming tao ang nakapaligid sa kanya?", 
				"I finally mustered the courage to reach out and ask her if I could court her.  I'm feeling both nervous and happy, and I'm thrilled that she agreed.o(≧v≦)o", 
				"We went to their house with my friends just to ask Tito and Tita if I could court their daughter. I was very nervous at that time. Nagmano ako kay Tito and then asked, 'Tito, puwede ko po bang ligawan si ------?' I vividly remember what Tito said: 'Kung gusto niyang magpaligaw, edi mayat. Haan ko met iggim diyay desisyon ti anak ko.' His eyes showed how much he really cares about his daughter, and I promised myself at that moment that I would make her happy, never hurt her, and give her the love she deserves.(/ω＼)",
				"I continued to court her through chats since it was the pandemic, and we were far apart. Sometimes, there were misunderstandings, but we always managed to work things out. I learned a lot from her as she kept educating me on what I shouldn't do. That's one of the reasons why I fell even harder for her.", 
				"I'm incredibly proud of this amazing girl. She deserves so much more than the world can offer. She's an absolute angel—strong and resilient, facing her challenges head-on without ever giving up, no matter how tough things get.", 
				"Her strength inspires me to tackle my own problems. She may not realize it, but she's helped me more than I can express, and I don't know how I'll ever repay her. Just in case she hasn't heard this recently, I'm telling her now: I'm so proud of you.", 
				"Things didn't go as planned. We were both very busy with school and had a lot to accomplish. Our schedules conflicted, and at that time, we both decided to stop and focus on our own goals. We were both not ready to commit to a relationship because things weren't working out. I know it's hard for both of us, but we need to, even though it's difficult.", 
				"The sunset is beautiful, isn't it?", 
				"See you in the aisle.", 
				"Watching her like Mona Lisa.", 
				"Even as time marches on, measured by countless sunsets, my love remains steadfast, like the unwavering promise of dawn.",
				"Sana kung pwede na, pwede pa...",
