				"Hello there, cutiee~", 
				"Upon our first encounter, \nI never anticipated the profound affection I would develop for her. \nIndeed, who could resist her ethereal beauty, \nintelligence, and strong family values? \nHer captivating personality is simply irresistible.",
				"The first time I laid eyes on her, my heart quietly wondered, 'Is she the one?' As we began to talk, it murmured, 'Maybe she is.' But when our eyes finally met, my heart begged, 'Oh Lord, let her be The One meant for me.",
				"Every morning, she's the first thought that fills my mind, and with every beautiful thing I see, it's always her I think of. As I marvel at the sunset, a soft smile touches my lips because her angelic smile drifts into my thoughts. Of all the beauty in this world, she's my favorite. Her smile shines brighter than the sun, her eyes sparkle like city lights in the night, and her presence is like the moon, lighting up even my darkest moments. She is the most beautiful thing in my life.",
				"How could I ever stop thinking about her? No matter what I do, every thought leads back to her—it's always been her. How can you blame me when she's the most precious person I long to call 'mine'? But can I? She fills my mind every hour of every day, yet I wonder—do I ever cross her mind the way she constantly crosses mine?",
				"Yeyyy, I was with her at the DSPC, and I remember that moment when our feet touched. It was so comforting. It means so much to me that she didn't mind when I constantly rubbed or touched her feet with mine. I fell for her even more; I could have died in that moment.(｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡",
				"I don't know why I constantly think about her. She always catches my attention, but I try not to show it.",
				"I constantly see her in my peripheral vision.  Naramdaman mo ba yung feeling na siya lang nakikita mo kahit andaming tao ang nakapaligid sa kanya?", 
				"I finally mustered the courage to reach out and ask her if I could court her.  I'm feeling both nervous and happy, and I'm thrilled that she agreed.o(≧v≦)o",
				"Naalala ko pa yung unang convo namin sobrang awkward, 'di kasi ako marunong mag-initiate ng chat, kasi first time ko makipag chat noon, 'di lang siguro sanay... sobrang cringe at sobrang kalat pa nung batang Paul nayun",
				"We went to their house with my friends just to ask Tito and Tita if I could court their daughter. I was very nervous at that time. Nagmano ako kay Tito and then asked, 'Tito, puwede ko po bang ligawan si ------?' I vividly remember what Tito said: 'Kung gusto niyang magpaligaw, edi mayat. Haan ko met iggim diyay desisyon ti anak ko.' His eyes showed how much he really cares about his daughter, and I promised myself at that moment that I would make her happy, never hurt her, and give her the love she deserves.(/ω＼)",
				"I continued to court her through chats since it was the pandemic, and we were far apart. Sometimes, there were misunderstandings, but we always managed to work things out. I learned a lot from her as she kept educating me on what I shouldn't do. That's one of the reasons why I fell even harder for her.", 
				"Waahhh, she sent me a voice message, and it's the sweetest voice I've ever heard. It's like a sweet melody that's been playing on repeat in my head all day, driving me crazy in the best possible way.",
				"I've loved watching her, and even though there are moments when I can't fully understand her, that's exactly what pulls me closer. She's like a captivating puzzle—beautiful, mysterious, and always keeping me enchanted. There may be times when choosing her feels uncertain, but my heart never hesitates. It chooses her, again and again, without question.",
				"I may not fully understand the depths of who she is, both inside and out, but that doesn't stop me from being utterly captivated by the journey of knowing her. Perhaps that's the essence of loving someone—it's sometimes irrational, but always worth it. So, yes, if this isn't love, then I don't know what is. It wouldn't make sense if all this time, wanting her was merely infatuation or just some fleeting phase of growing up.",
				"I'm incredibly proud of this amazing girl. She deserves so much more than the world can offer. She's an absolute angel—strong and resilient, facing her challenges head-on without ever giving up, no matter how tough things get.", 
				"Her strength inspires me to tackle my own problems. She may not realize it, but she's helped me more than I can express, and I don't know how I'll ever repay her. Just in case she hasn't heard this recently, I'm telling her now: I'm so proud of you.", 
				"Things didn't go as planned. We were both very busy with school and had a lot to accomplish. Our schedules conflicted, and at that time, we both decided to stop and focus on our own goals. We were both not ready to commit to a relationship because things weren't working out. I know it's hard for both of us, but we need to, even though it's difficult.",
				"The truth is, simply wanting you has never been enough. I've cherished you from the very start, and that feeling has only deepened with time. It's why I long for you even more, even though I understand you're not quite ready yet. I respect that completely. I know we both have our priorities for now. We have so much obligation to do; goals to fulfill and things to enjoy alone. I want you to experience all of that for now.",
				"And I want you to embrace all of that, to live fully and freely in this moment. And I hope that one day, perhaps, we'll share those moments together. May you never get tired of pursuing the things you love for now. May you fulfill all your goals as I watch you with firm belief that you can do it. Just always know that I am here, and I have always been with you. Certainly, you are worth the wait-all the time. I love you, silently.",
				"Letting you go is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but I want you to know that you are the most incredible person I've ever known. You brought me more happiness in our short time together than I could have ever imagined, and I'll be forever grateful for that. Saying goodbye to you, my love, breaks my heart, but I know I have to.",
				"I pray that this amazing woman finds all the happiness she deserves, living her best life, even though we're apart. Though distance separates us, I can't help but dream that fate will bring us together again, somewhere, sometime, in the most unexpected way. As she chases her dreams and I follow mine, my heart quietly beats for her, always cheering her on from afar.",
				"I'm sorry, but my heart can't seem to fall for anyone else but you...",
				"I saw you in my dreams again, I held you a little tighter 'cause I knew when I wake up you'd be gone.",
				"See you in the aisle.", 
				"Watching her like Mona Lisa.", 
				"Even as time marches on, measured by countless sunsets, my love remains steadfast, like the unwavering promise of dawn.",
				"Sana kung pwede na, pwede pa...",
				"damn, I miss everything about us..."
